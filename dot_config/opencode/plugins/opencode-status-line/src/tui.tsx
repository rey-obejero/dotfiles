/**
 * opencode-status-line — a live usage-and-speed status line for OpenCode's CLI
 * prompt footer: context window, cache, streaming speed, cost, elapsed time
 * and uncommitted changes in one row, drawn in one UI slot or several at once
 * (`surface`) and configurable per segment (`usage.segments`, overridable per
 * placement through `usage.surfaces`).
 *
 * The speed segment carries two live readings. OpenCode only learns exact token
 * counts when a step settles — ends or fails — so the live figures are
 * estimated from streamed output (`session.text.delta`,
 * `session.reasoning.delta`, `session.tool.input.delta`) and calibrated
 * against the exact counts on `session.step.ended` and `session.step.failed`.
 * Reasoning and visible output keep separate characters-per-token ratios,
 * tool input counting as output; small steps accumulate until they teach
 * together:
 *
 *   sliding     ↯  what the last few seconds look like, right now
 *   cumulative  μ  the average since the turn began — exact tokens from every
 *                  finished step of the turn plus the step in flight; a queued
 *                  prompt starts its own turn, a steer stays in the current one
 *
 * The settled figure measures decode time: its span prefers the observed decode
 * clock, then the host's stream boundary (`session.step.streamed`, published
 * before tool settlement), so time a tool spent running is not charged. It
 * folds the whole turn (configurable) and the sliding reading comes to rest
 * once a stream stops — `window.hold: true` keeps it at a dimmed `0.0` over an
 * empty gauge, `false` hides it, `"last"` keeps the last value — so the line
 * keeps its shape without re-showing a figure nothing is producing. A session
 * met without a meter (a resume, a plugin reload) has its settled figure
 * rebuilt from the last turn's recorded messages, so the meter segment does not
 * come back blank — it shows the settled average over a resting `↯ 0.0` and an
 * empty gauge. The sliding window's samples are delta arrival times no record
 * keeps, so a real `↯` figure only returns with the next stream. The gauge
 * stays on screen while the sliding figure rests, figures are speed-coloured,
 * and `/opencode-status-line` shows the numbers behind them.
 *
 * Configuration lives in `~/.config/opencode/opencode-status-line.json` and a
 * project's `.opencode-status-line.json` — see config.ts. The plugin lives in
 * this checkout and is listed in cli.json by absolute path; no build step,
 * OpenCode transpiles the TSX on load and resolves the imports itself.
